# Great Week

Great Week is an Android application for planning a week according to the method of Stephen Covey.

## How To Use

Great Week pipeline involves four key activities.

### Identify roles

Write down your key roles. Just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the next seven days. For example:

- Individual
- Husband
- Father
- Manager Administration

### Select goals

Think of two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals.

### Plan

Having identified roles and set goals, you can translate each goal to a specific day of the week, either as a priority item or, even better, as a specific appointment.
